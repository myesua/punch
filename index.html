				<h1>Minimum wage: Labour rejects govs bid to take over negotiations</h1>
				<small class="news-date">June 29, 2024</small>
				<img src="media/labour-ng.jpg" alt="Nigeria Labour" />
				<small class="reporters">Chukwudi Akasike and Olufemi Adediran</small>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Govs unfriendly, some states yet to pay N30, 000 approved five years
						ago – NLC</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						States should be allowed to negotiate with workers, govs
						insist</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Organised Labour, including the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade
					Union Congress, has rejected the proposal of the Southern Governors’
					Forum to decentralise minimum wage negotiations to state governments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The NLC condemned the proposal as “unfriendly and anti-worker”, noting
					that allowing states to determine their minimum wages would be
					detrimental to workers’ welfare.
				</p>
				<p>
					On Friday, The PUNCH had reported that the Southern Governors’ Forum
					sought for states to be allowed to negotiate the minimum wage for
					workers independently. At the end of a meeting held on Monday at the
					Ogun State Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta, the forum resolved that
					wages should be reflective of the cost of living.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was revealed in a communique issued from the meeting and signed
					by the newly-appointed Chairman of the forum, Governor Dapo Abiodun of
					Ogun State; and Vice-Chairman, Prof Charles Soludo of Anambra State.
				</p>
				<p>
					The meeting was attended by Governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State;
					Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos; Godwin Obaseki of Edo; Hope Uzodinma of
					Imo; Abiodun Oyebanji of Ekiti; Duoye Diri of Bayelsa; Ademola Adeleke
					of Osun; Umo Eno of Akwa Ibom; Siminalayi Fubara of Rivers; and Bassey
					Otu of Cross River.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other attendees included Governors Francis Nwifuru of Ebonyi State;
					Lucky Aiyedatiwa of Ondo; Peter Mbah of Enugu; Sheriff Oborevwori of
					Delta State; and Alex Otti of Abia State.
				</p>
				<p>
					“The forum discussed the minimum wage demanded by Labour and
					unanimously agreed that the minimum wage should be reflective of the
					cost of living, and that each state should be allowed to negotiate its
					minimum wage,” the communique stated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the Presidency had on Monday appealed to Nigerians not to
					put unnecessary pressure on the President, assuring them that the
					Federal Government would transmit the proposed bill on the new minimum
					wage to the National Assembly once it was ready.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo
					Onanuga, made the plea in a terse statement sent to The PUNCH on
					Thursday.
				</p>
				<p>“People should be patient,” he stated.</p>
				<p>
					While Organised Labour is adamant about its N250,000 minimum wage
					demand, the state governors said that paying even the N62,000 proposed
					by the Federal Government would plunge many states into debt.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was even as President Bola Tinubu demanded more time for
					consultation on Wednesday.
				</p>

				<h3>Labour insists on national minimum wage</h3>

				<p>
					Reacting to the proposal of the governors, the National Treasurer of
					the NLC, Akeem Ambali, in an interview with Saturday PUNCH, insisted
					that the governors had no power to negotiate the new minimum wage.
				</p>

				<p>
					He added that the governors were compelled by law to implement the new
					national minimum wage. Ambali advised the governors to stop trying to
					strong-arm the Federal Government and labour with their request to
					negotiate with labour individually, and rather focus on how they would
					implement the national minimum wage when it is approved.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ambali noted that it was regrettable that labour had to always resort
					to strike actions to get the government to yield to its demands. He
					asked the governors make public how much they earn, and subject it to
					negotiations.
				</p>

				<p>
					He said, “Traditionally, the minimum wage is a national issue; it is
					not a sub-national negotiation. That is the essence of the Minimum
					Wage Act, and the law is clear. Governors don’t have the power to
					negotiate the minimum wage. What they can only negotiate are other
					allowances, but the minimum wage is a social protection content, and
					it is not only applicable to Nigeria.
				</p>

				<p>
					“My advice for the governors is that they should prepare their balance
					sheet and look at how to implement the national minimum wage once it
					is approved. They should not stress themselves with the issue of
					negotiating with Labour on a state level. After all, we have seen what
					happened in Zamfara, where they refused to pay the current minimum
					wage (N30,000) until Labour issued an ultimatum, and they quickly
					started paying. Some states are still not paying the current minimum
					wage. We know what happened in Anambra, which is the state of the Vice
					Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum, Charles Soludo. When you
					look at all that, you will realise that some of them (governors) may
					not have good intentions. In fact, the majority of them are not
					labour-friendly and they are not pro-workers.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Ambali further urged President Bola Tinubu to go ahead and recommend
					the new minimum wage to the National Assembly after consultation with
					Organised Labour on the agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					“It is a tripartite committee. Two are on the same page, because they
					are employers, and the two cumulatively amount to one, because they
					are both employees. It is only the employees that are agitating,
					because they are the ones that feel the pinch; they know where it
					hurts. Mr President should concentrate his energy on engaging Labour
					with realistic data and statistics, which can be obtained from the
					Federal Bureau of Statistics. How much does it take to feed a family
					in a month? We should be guided by that. Once we are able to do that
					and we are sincere about it, the president can then engage labour, and
					we will resolve this amicably,” he added.
				</p>
				<p>
					Speaking on the governors who were still defaulting, Ambali said,
					“While we commend those who are paying the minimum wage, we also
					condemn those who are not paying, because they are earning their own
					fantastic salaries. Maybe the option will eventually be to refer
					salary payment of governors to the minimum wage as well, so we can
					also put it up for debate by a committee. Once we are able to do that,
					nobody will have the effrontery to say they want to first negotiate
					with workers at the governors’ level”
				</p>

				<p>
					The labour leader also said it was looking as though the Organised
					Private Sector was being influenced by the government. He noted that
					when the negotiations began, the OPS stated that no one earned less
					than N93,000 in any private establishment. He stated that it was
					shocking that those same people now wanted to pay less than N70,000.
					He added, “This is because of the influence of some of the governors,
					who tried to cajole them to fall in line. The OPS, if left on their
					own, are ready to pay, so all these arguments that they are bringing
					up are afterthoughts.”
				</p>

				<p>
					The NLC further cautioned state governors against exhibiting
					dictatorial tendencies. The congress noted that it was compelled to
					address the recent statements made by some governors regarding their
					desire to pay what they deemed fit to Nigerian workers as the minimum
					wage.
				</p>

				<p>
					“This notion is not only dictatorial but also undermines the very
					essence of having a national minimum wage in Nigeria,” the NLC’s
					spokesperson, Benson Upah, stated in a statement sent to The PUNCH in
					Abuja.
				</p>

				<p>
					Explaining the concept of a national minimum wage, Upah noted that it
					was not an arbitrary decision. He said, “It represents a national wage
					floor; a baseline below which no worker should be paid. This threshold
					is a collective agreement that ensures a minimum standard of living
					for every worker. The governors’ demand to unilaterally determine the
					minimum wage negates this principle and threatens the welfare of
					Nigerian workers and the national economy.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Upah stressed that it was important to remind the governors that the
					national minimum wage was not synonymous with the individual pay
					structures of the states, which they implement religiously, reflecting
					their unique financial capabilities and circumstances. He further
					added that the diversity in pay structures underscored the flexibility
					that already existed within the system, allowing states to reward
					their workers in alignment with their financial realities.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Furthermore, the governors’ argument appears inconsistent when
					juxtaposed with the remuneration of political office holders. Why is
					there no hue and cry when political office holders across the nation
					receive uniform salaries as determined by the Revenue Mobilisation,
					Allocation and Fiscal Commission? This double standard, which pits a
					privileged few against the poor majority, is an issue that should be
					of concern to those who love this country.”
				</p>

				<h3>Caution govs, TUC tells president</h3>

				<p>
					Also commenting, the Deputy President of the TUC, Dr Tommy Etim, said
					Organised Labour would not negotiate with governors. In an interview
					with Saturday PUNCH, he said, “They are trying to create an
					unnecessary problem where there is none. I think Mr President should
					caution them, because pensions and the minimum wage are constitutional
					issues, and they are under the exclusive legislation.
				</p>

				<p>
					“If the national minimum wage is approved today, it is incumbent on
					them to implement it. They can either negotiate it upwards or stop any
					negotiation, because it is not within their purview. The issue of the
					national minimum wage is tripartite in nature, and that is what we
					have done. Once the president ends the consultation, he will
					definitely send it to the National Assembly for them to legislate on
					it, so that it will be returned for the president’s assent.”
				</p>

				<p>
					He added that no state governor had the right to negotiate the minimum
					wage downwards. “They can only negotiate it upwards. Labour doesn’t
					even have the right to negotiate the minimum wage with state
					governors. It is a tripartite committee for a reason.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Etim further urged workers to remain resolute and believe in the
					negotiation, hopeful that the Federal Government would do the needful.
				</p>

				<h3>Govs should pay better wage – <span>Expert</span></h3>

				<p>
					Reacting to the minimum wage issue, an economist and development
					expert, Aliyu Ilias, asked the governors to tread with caution.
					According to Ilias, the governors must surpass their current stance
					and commit to implementing a higher minimum wage.
				</p>

				<p>
					He added that despite federal subsidies intended to support state
					finances, the responsibility lay with state leaders to improve wage
					conditions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ilias said, “I don’t think the governors have an excuse. They just
					have to move from where they are and pay better minimum wage. Since
					the Federal Government has removed subsidy, money is getting to them.
					There are about 20 million Nigerians working for the government, at
					federal, state and local government levels. And, we have to consider
					the private sector too. The private sector may not be able to afford
					that N62,000. Also, the state governments are very key, as they cannot
					even pay the N30,000. Some are still paying N18,000.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Ilias also called for clarity from the government regarding the role
					of the Federation Account Allocation Committee in funding wage
					increases. He urged concerted efforts between the government and
					labour unions to resolve the ongoing disagreements, particularly
					noting tensions between the NLC and southern governors.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Our government should be clear on whether the Federation Account
					Allocation Committee is part of the reason they are expecting them to
					pay that salary to that level. I think the tripartite committee needs
					to work well. And, the president should consult more to have a better
					resolution,” he said.
